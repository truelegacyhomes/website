<section  class='av_textblock_section av-lea7xa3n-f4bdbffd741c9145a1db4cf073a83703 '  ><p>Etiquette and manners are taught since we are in school and it is still necessary to remind ourselves how to behave and what to take care of before anything messes up. Estate sales are known for their excitement, socialism, and valuable hidden gems that could potentially be the reason for making a fortune. It is indeed a great experience even if you are having a day out and have no intention to buy anything, estate sales can provide a different kind of experience that many of you would like to have again and again.</p>
<p>However, there are a few important things to keep in mind before you take a drive and arrive at someone else’s place. <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-sales/newport-beach-ca/"><strong>Estate sales Newport Beach</strong></a> have certain rules, regulations or you can say etiquette that must not be broken at all costs. In the end, you will be navigating through the family’s precious items that are now available for sale. They have invested time, money and perhaps hired an estate sale company – if they encounter something inappropriate from the visitors this could ruin their mood and might cause little trouble for you as well.</p>
<p>So, behave your best and have a soft spot for the family who recently lost their beloved family member. If next Thursday is booked on your calendar for buying some vintage furniture, antiques, and artworks; congratulations, we hope your visit turns out to be a profitable one but make sure you know how to interact before killing your chances of making that sweet profit. Let’s get into it:</p>
<p>Etiquette includes not cutting in line, not grabbing things out of people’s hands, and other common sense manners. Remember this was someone’s home… and will likely be someone’s home again. So respecting the space is important. Stay out of the areas that are clearly marked with “do not enter.” <strong>(<a href="https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/estate-sale-shopping-tips-and-advice-37037751" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>)</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Stick To The Rules Of The Sale – No Haggling Or Bartering</strong></h2>
<p>No matter how much you want it, haggling or bartering is considered rude. There will be a price tag for every item on display. It has been fixed by the estate sale company in advance and you must stick to it for the betterment of yourself and the host too. Sometimes people are able to get a discount if they buy in bulk but that’s up to the host. Don’t argue, be polite and enjoy your hunt.</p>
<h2><strong>Be Respectful & Stay Alert</strong></h2>
<p>It is not like you have come to hang out with friends. You must stay alert at all times. It will help if you take a list of items you are looking to buy and don’t wander around aimlessly. No smoking, no drinking, no walking on the grass, and no entering the room where you are not allowed. Also peering into windows, cabinets or drawers is not okay. “No Running” that’s right – kids usually don’t listen to this rule but it is your job to not let them run around the house. Some estate sale companies don’t allow kids at all. Make sure to park your ride in the designated area and keep neighbors in mind – driveways, mailboxes, and alleyways must not be blocked.</p>
<h2><strong>Respect The Host’s Space – Be Polite And Courteous</strong></h2>
<p>It is understandable that when you visit an estate sale, your adrenaline starts pumping, and all the excitement of finding something valuable peaks. Try to control it and behave like a mature adult because this is how you show respect for the host’s home. Don’t move around too much and try to talk with a calm voice as if you are paying a visit to a dear one.</p>
<h2><strong>Pay Attention To The Displays</strong></h2>
<p>Display signs are there to inform you about the items on sale and their prices. What if you accidentally purchase a damaged item without looking and then find out it is faulty? That will be your loss. So, pay attention to what’s on display and check the items before buying. We know vintage products might have little scratches but make sure it is in good working condition.</p>
<h2><strong>Always Ask For Permission</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to check out something from the corner of the room, make sure you ask permission from the staff or host before touching anything. This way, it will be easier for them to keep track of where everything is and what has been bought by whom. Make yourself comfortable and don’t be afraid to ask questions if you are unclear about anything.</p>
<h2><strong>Don’t Low-ball – Respect The Prices</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-sales/newport-beach-ca/"><strong>Estate sales in Newport Beach</strong></a> usually feature some of the most valuable items that could turn into long-term investments. Don’t try to entertain yourself by lowballing the prices as it will disturb the host and lead nowhere. Imagine if someone comes to your house and starts arguing about the prices of everything, would you feel good? No, so don’t do it in someone else’s home.</p>
<h2><strong>Be Mindful Of Your Surroundings – Don’t Block Other Shoppers, Keep Noise Levels Down</strong></h2>
<p>You are not the only one looking for some juicy deals, there are other buyers too. Blocking others or monopolizing a section of the house is not the right way. The same goes for talking loudly and disturbing others’ shopping experience. Just keep the noise level at normal levels so that everyone can shop without any tension or hassle.</p>
<h2><strong>Do Not Make Insensitive Comments</strong></h2>
<p>Someone in the house might recently have lost a family member, or something else may be going on in the background. Don’t make insensitive comments about anything and avoid passing judgment on anything. This is not the time and place to do that. Stick to your hunt and enjoy it as much as you can but don’t forget for you it is just an estate sale, for the host, it is a well-deserved goodbye. If you are 100% sure about the items that you will buy, ask an employee to tag those items, however, only tag items when you have made up your mind. Make sure to check the estate sale organizers’ sold tag policies.</p>
<h2><strong>Don’t Shop From The Hold Table</strong></h2>
<p>The hold table has items that are reserved for buyers who already bought them. Don’t shop from there unless you are the one who reserved the items. Items visible on a hold table are not to be touched or moved around in any way. Although it is rare, sometimes people steal stuff from the hold tables.</p>
<h2><strong>Bring Your Own Shopping Bags To Help With Carrying Your Purchases Away</strong></h2>
<p>Your own bags or boxes will be a great help to you and the staff during the checkout process. Companies prefer bags that are easy to look through so that the staff can see what exactly you are carrying out of the house.</p>
<h2><strong>Pay in Cash or Credit Card</strong></h2>
<p>Cash is always the best option but credit cards are also acceptable. Cash plays a major role in <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-sales/newport-beach-ca/"><strong>Newport Beach estate sales</strong></a> and you might score some awesome deals if you offer cash to the staff. Make sure to have enough cash for your purchases.</p>
<h2><strong>Have Fun & Enjoy Your Shopping Adventure</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/How-to-Compare-Estate-Sale-Prices"><strong>Estate sales Mission Viejo</strong></a> are all about finding something unique and rare, if you follow these simple rules you will be able to turn your visit into an adventure. Have fun, meet new people, and find some amazing items while you are at it. At the end of the day, you will have some amazing finds that are worth much more than their price tag. We wish you the best of luck with your estate sale scavenger hunt.</p>
