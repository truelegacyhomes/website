<p>As the United States senior population continues to grow, older adults are searching for viable senior living options that meet their needs. Many senior citizens choose assisted living communities, which serve as a bridge between independent living and skilled nursing home care.</p>
<p>Assisted living communities are designed to care for older adults’ bodies and minds. Activity directors plan a multitude of activities and events that will likely appeal to seniors. In fact, residents often enjoy a high quality of life and increased well-being because of the various programs. Keep reading to learn more about the different assisted living activities.</p>
<h2>What is an Assisted Living Community?</h2>
<p>In an assisted living community, caregivers provide <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/assisted-living-vs-nursing-homes/">resident support services</a>, such as bathing, dressing, continence care, medication supervision, and meal consumption. If the facility includes a memory care and</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease wing, residents receive additional healthcare services. Assisted living residents would otherwise require some degree of home-based caregiving services, and they would likely be isolated within their houses.</p>
<p>The assisted living community also provides residents with several non-care services. Examples include housekeeping, laundry, and transportation to errands and doctors’ appointments. Family members are often relieved that their loved one is receiving the care they need.</p>
<h2>Positive Outcomes of Senior Living Activity Programs</h2>
<p>Assisted living community residents enjoy many physically and mentally stimulating activities. Whether held onsite or within the surrounding community, activities offer residents plenty of opportunities to broaden their horizons.</p>
<p>During each activity, senior living community residents frequently engage with their neighbors and friends. These interactions set the stage for meaningful relationships that can last for years. Residents of <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/continuing-care-retirement-communities/">continuing care</a> retirement communities often share similar experiences.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Regular Physical Exercise</h3>
<p>Many assisted living activities involve some type of physical movement. With indoor and outdoor exercise options available, residents are encouraged to move their bodies daily.</p>
<p>When older adults engage in regular exercise, they receive numerous proven benefits. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/sgr/olderad.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centers for Disease Control</a> and Prevention notes that dedicated older exercisers often develop improved muscle strength, and over time they build more stamina.</p>
<p>Consistent exercise also helps to build healthier bones and joints. With a stronger body structure, seniors lessen their risk of falls and possible fractures. These older adults may also experience decreased arthritis-related pain and joint swelling.</p>
<p>Seniors who remain physically active are less likely to develop high blood pressure, diabetes, and colon cancer. And, exercise reduces older adults&#8217; risk of dying from coronary heart disease-linked problems.</p>
<p>Finally, physically active older adults may notice reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. At the same time, they experience more feelings of well-being, a generally sunnier mood, and a higher quality of life.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Ongoing Mental Stimulation</h3>
<p>Consistently exercising the mind also brings several recognized benefits. First, regular mental stimulation plays a key role in maintaining cognitive abilities, such as solving a puzzle or analyzing a problem. Plus, mastering a new skill, delving into a hobby, or learning the basics of a foreign language often creates a real sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Staying mentally active also enables older adults to maintain valuable emotional connections to their families, friends, and neighbors. When someone is actively engaged with the world around them, they’re more likely to cultivate relationships with others. Collectively, all of these benefits help seniors to maintain better overall health for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Residents in the community’s memory care and Alzheimer’s wing can also benefit from some types of mental stimulation. Trained therapists understand each resident’s needs, and apply carefully chosen techniques to encourage positive responses.</p>

<h2>List of 103 Assisted Living Community Activities</h2>
<p>A vibrant assisted living community offers a veritable feast of senior living activities. In fact, numerous indoor and outdoor activities beckon residents on any given day. These activities help to enrich each resident’s quality of life.</p>
<p>Assisted living activities include planned and spontaneous excursions that offer enjoyable opportunities to gather with friends and take in the sights.</p>
<p>Visiting entertainers, virtual classes, and special events round out this list of 103 assisted living activities. Taken together, these assisted living activities ideas help to improve residents’ well-being and quality of life.</p>
<h3>Onsite Activities: Indoors</h3>
<p>Assisted living community activity directors are always looking for creative ways to keep residents engaged and encourage mental stimulation. This is especially important when weather conditions aren&#8217;t conducive to spending time outside.</p>
<p>Fortunately, every retirement community can implement a variety of small-group activities to suit residents&#8217; capabilities and tastes. Local senior center programs and activities may mirror this approach.</p>
<p>Indoor activities often take place in the senior living facility&#8217;s community room or dedicated activity room. Holding activities in one of the dining rooms is another option.</p>

<h2>Adding More Energizing Activities</h2>
<p>With assisted living residents’ creativity and adventurous spirit, they are likely to come up with another great activity idea (or two)! Residents can harness their imaginations, and bring their ideas to frequent brainstorming sessions.</p>
<p>Taking it a step further, residents can share those ideas with assisted living facility leaders and activity professionals. If funds and staffing are available, the residents may even play a role in moving the activities forward.</p>
<h3>Creating an Enriching Quality of Life</h3>
<p>A vibrant senior living community features a wide selection of activities that appeal to senior citizens’ diverse tastes. By exercising their bodies and challenging their minds, assisted living residents can enjoy an enriching quality of life.</p>
<h2>Facilitating an Assisted Living Experience</h2>
<p>Maybe you think your parents are good candidates for an assisted living facility. They’d appreciate some help with their activities of daily living (ADLs), and you know they’d enjoy the resident activities. Before you move forward, though, you’ll need to determine how your parents will pay for their assisted living services.</p>
<p>First, you may <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/medicare-assisted-living/">wonder if Medicare pays</a> for assisted living expenses. Unfortunately, Medicare does not cover any type of residential or custodial care costs, including assisted living expenses. As a result, Medicare Part A, Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part C are off-limits as potential resources.</p>
<p>However, Medicare will cover a resident’s healthcare services, as stated in their Medicare Beneficiary Agreement. A participating Medicare health professional must perform this “medically necessary” service.</p>
<p>Investigate several other potential sources of funds. Personal financial resources, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Medicaid Program funds may be viable options. Tapping into Veterans Aid and Attendance benefits, long-term care insurance, certain life insurance benefits, and a reverse mortgage may also be feasible.</p>
<p>After you secure the assisted living funds, get the ball rolling with an assisted living <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/checklist-moving-parents/">moving process checklist</a>. You’ll have a million details to remember, and the checklist will help you to complete the necessary steps in order.</p>
<p>Next, realize your parents can’t take all their possessions with them. With a helpful <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/downsize-home-checklist/">home downsizing checklist</a>, they can choose the furniture, appliances, and personal items that they need or want in their new home.</p>
<p>Selling the remaining items via a <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/">professionally organized estate sale</a> will generate funds for assisted living expenses. Once the estate sale company empties the house, it can be listed for sale, after which more funds will be available.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve already talked to your elderly parents about moving to an assisted living community. You know that assisted living is the best choice for your parents’ well-being. However, you got a rather hostile reception, and you’re frustrated and discouraged.</p>
<p>If you’re at a loss about the next step to take, <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/elderly-parent-refuses-assisted-living/">view these eight suggestions</a>. They may help to lessen the hostility and create a productive environment that leads to your loved ones getting the care they need and the quality of life they deserve.</p>
