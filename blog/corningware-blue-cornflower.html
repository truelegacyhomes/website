<section  class='av_textblock_section av-jyys5sdr-87bc1b9b82e47d14ad32862eda727900 '  ><p>Corningware Blue Cornflower kitchenware has been an integral part of American households for over 60 years. The collection includes a casserole set, a baking dish set, and a bowl set. Whether you are needing a ramekin, pie plates, petite pans, roasters, or sauce-makers. Knife sets, mixing bowls, and glassware round out this kitchenware ensemble. For beverage service, percolators and teapots are also available.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll learn how to identify these much-loved Blue Cornflower pieces and obtain useful tips on their current market values. Most importantly, you’ll find sources for this iconic kitchenware, so you can begin your own Blue Cornflower collection.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The company launched the first collection was made in 1958. It was manufactured in Corning, New York. It was marketed as the first oven-to-dinner-table cookware. The wide-ranging collection displays an exquisite Blue Cornflower. This stylized floral bouquet look features a beautiful and simple wildflower design.</p>
<p>Corningware products were innovative. Crafted from Pyroceram, a World War II-era composite, they can withstand extreme temperatures with no ill effects. Corning topped its casserole dishes and other bakeware with the company’s renowned Pyrex glass lids.</p>
<p>After decades of continued popularity, Corning ceased production of Pyroceram-based Corningware in 2000. In 2001, the company rebranded with stoneware-themed bakeware.</p>
<p>Today, vintage pieces are extremely desirable collectibles. They are especially popular among baby boomers who grew up with this beautiful, functional cookware.</p>
<p>Corningware represents one of many trending mid-century modern items with a nostalgic connection to a simpler time.</p>
<h2>Spotlight on the Pieces</h2>
<p>Corningware’s legendary Pyroceram-based kitchenware was made with World War II technology.  The Corningware products are popular because of their ability to withstand drastic temperature changes while maintaining their integrity. For example, a Pyroceram-based</p>
<p>Corningware casserole dish can safely be used in the oven or broiler. This casserole dish is also adaptable to stovetop use. Plus, it’s microwave-safe if it doesn’t have metal components.</p>
<p>Pyroceram-based cookware also has high chip and crack resistance. It can be stored in the fridge or freezer, and it’s dishwasher-safe. As the icing on the cake, this striking line of cookware and bakeware makes an attractive addition to the dining table.</p>
<h2>The Collection</h2>

Certain products, such as Corningware casserole dishes, were available in several sizes. Other products were grouped into Corningware sets.</p>

<h2>How to Identify Vintage Blue Cornflower Pieces</h2>
<p>When Corningware introduced the Blue Cornflower collection in 1958, consumers snapped up the pieces like hotcakes. Immediately, other manufacturers created nearly identical copycat products, designed to capitalize on the Blue Cornflower buying frenzy.</p>
<p>If you’re considering a Blue Cornflower purchase, determine the item’s authenticity before you pay. And don’t be fooled by sellers who claim their item is an antique. Neither the Blue Cornflower piece or the copycat item is a potential antique. Visit this page to learn the <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/vintage-vs-antique/">difference between antique and vintage</a>.</p>
<h3>Examine the Backstamp</h3>
<p>You can determine an approximate age for your piece by looking at its backstamp. Each piece of plates has a one on its underside.</p>
<p>Before 1998, the  read “Corning Ware” in two words. In 1998, the company switched to a one-word “Corningware”. In 2002, Corning discontinued their kitchenware. But in 2009, the company brought its iconic kitchenware back. The newly made pieces displayed a one-word “CorningWare”.</p>
<h3>Verify the Pattern</h3>
<p>Corningware was known for having appealing patterns. In fact, a piece’s pattern can indicate whether the item is vintage…or not.</p>
<p>The original Blue Cornflower pattern features a three-cornflower design with lovely blue cornflowers on a solid white background. The Blue Cornflower pattern was a mainstay over many years of production.</p>
<h3>Ask a Glass Expert</h3>
<p>Ask a recognized glass expert whether you have a vintage piece. Or, a knowledgeable antique dealer may provide an informed opinion. Consult a reference book.</p>
<p>They contain descriptions, photographs, and product era details on many pieces.<br />
Contact an online authenticator. Provide a description of the piece, along with photographs that show all the item’s features. If the piece contains defects, point them out. This ensures they have all the facts before giving their opinion.</p>
<h2>Vintage Blue Cornflower Bakeware Values</h2>
<p>Vintage Blue Cornflower Bakeware prices are all over the map. On the lower end, pieces may have asking prices of $.50 to $10. You’re likely to encounter these super-low prices at yard sales, <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-sales/">estate sales</a>, and thrift shops. This tends to happen because workers are unaware of Vintage Blue Cornflower values.</p>
<p>Less-common items may be within the $30 to $50 range. Blue Cornflower pieces with manufacturing flaws or with limited production runs will likely have hefty prices.</p>
