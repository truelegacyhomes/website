<section  class='av_textblock_section av-jyys5sdr-f20f5e2ab8846cb432f41a4d5a7c7955 '  ><p>As <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/">estate sale shoppers</a> browse sale venues across the United States, they’re always searching for Hummel plates to add to their collections. These delightful little bas relief plates feature whimsical themes and charming children. Learn how to identify these popular collectibles and obtain realistic selling prices.</p>
<h2>History of Hummel Plates</h2>
<p>Hummel plates are an offshoot of the <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/rare-hummel-figurines/">wildly popular Hummel figurines</a> that have been produced in Germany since 1935. In 1971, a German manufacturing company introduced a line of plates with similar motifs.</p>
<h3>Inspiration for Hummel Plates</h3>
<p>Hummel plates came from <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/hummel-figurines/">Hummel figurines</a>. The inspiration for the figurines came from the pen of Berta Hummel, a young German woman with uncanny artistic abilities. She refined her techniques at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich.</p>
<p>In 1934, Berta Hummel changed her life’s direction, taking her vows as a nun. Thereafter, she was called Sister Maria Innocentia Hummel. She lived at the convent of Siessen at Saulgau, teaching kindergarten and continuing her artwork.</p>
<h3>Birth of Hummel Figurines</h3>
<p>German manufacturer Franz Goebel decided to use Sister Maria’s sketches in his new figurines. In 1935, Goebel forged an agreement with the convent and Sister Maria Innocentia. Franz’s family-owned porcelain business, W. Goebel Porzellanfabrik, would carefully handcraft every figurine while Sister Maria retained final artistic control.</p>
<h3>Hummel Plates Production</h3>
<p>After many years of producing Hummel figurines, Franz Goebel introduced a similar line of Hummel plates. His whimsical creations immediately became popular with American collectors.</p>
<h3>The First Hummel Plate: 1971</h3>
<p>The very first hand-painted Hummel plate was introduced in 1971. This charming first edition “Heavenly Angel” plate premiered on the 100th anniversary of the Goebel factory opening.</p>
<p>Without the box, this lovely anniversary plate’s value is estimated at between $100 and $200. A plate with an excellent-condition box commands a higher price. In the 1980s, its price was an inflated $2,500, however its value is much less steep now.</p>
<h2>How to Identify Authentic M.I. Hummel Plates</h2>
<p>All Goebel-produced Hummel plates have specific marks printed on the back of the plate. Collectively, the marks identify the item as an authentic M.I. Hummel plate.</p>
<h3>Specific Marks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trademark:</strong> The back of the plate should show the “TMK” trademark printed in cobalt blue. This was the correct trademark on the manufacturing date.</li>
<li><strong>Circular Text Design:</strong> Each authentic Hummel plate has a circular text design with varying texts to describe the specifics of the plate.</li>
<li><strong>Plate Name and Series Descriptor:</strong> The plate name and plate series descriptor should also appear on the back of the plate.</li>
<li><strong>M.I. Hummel Name Position:</strong> The Hummel name should be positioned near the center of the circular text design.</li>
<li><strong>Position of Additional Identifiers:</strong> Look for Goebel’s full name, the plate name, or the plate series descriptor below or above the M.I. Hummel text.</li>
<li><strong>Full-Size Plate Text:</strong> Each plate should display the correct Goebel TMK logo and Hummel Number (ID Number) under the circular text.</li>
<li><strong>Mini-Plate Series Text:</strong> Each plate should show the proper Goebel TMK logo, along with the Hummel Number, above or below the core center printed text.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Missing Marks’ Significance</h3>
<p>The above marks are what you should expect to see on each authentic Hummel plate. If you don’t see most of these marks, it is probably not authentic. You most likely have a reproduction, a licensed piece from another company, or an item produced with legal access to earlier Berta Hummel artwork.</p>
<h2>Hummel Plates Value Guide</h2>
<p>There are quite a few factors that go into determining the worth of any specific Hummel plate. But, on average, Hummel plates’ values range from $10 to $200, depending on the age, condition, packaging, and sales venue.</p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>To determine a Hummel plate’s value, consider the plate’s production year. Hummel plates were produced from 1971 through 1995. The year of release marking, located on the plate’s underside, will tell you the plate’s age. Older Hummel plates have a higher market value than more recent versions.</p>
<h3>Cosmetic Condition</h3>
<p>A Hummel plate’s condition dictates its worth. Plates fall into several groups:</p>
<h4>Mint Condition</h4>
<p>A mint condition plate should come with its original box. Both the plate and box should be in perfect condition without any signs of wear or use. These Hummel plates bring the highest prices.</p>
<h4>Excellent Condition</h4>
<p>A Hummel plate in excellent condition generally comes in its original box, although the box may be somewhat worn. However, the plate should be in great condition. The plate should not show cracking, discoloration, staining, or other damage.</p>
<h4>Good Condition</h4>
<p>A Hummel plate in good condition may be missing its original box. The plate may show some discoloration, and some gold sponging may be gone. This plate may exhibit minor usage issues.</p>
<h4>Fair Condition</h4>
<p>These plates are usually without their original packaging. They typically show crazing, cracks, and/or chips. This damage generally drives the plate’s value down. Unless these damaged plates are among the very first Hummel plate editions, they aren’t worth very much.</p>
<h3>Original Box</h3>
<p>A Hummel plate in its original box has a higher market value than one without a box. Even if two plates are in similar condition, the boxed plate will bring a higher auction price.</p>
<h2>Collector Plate Market Volatility</h2>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, many manufacturers’ decorative plates were in high demand. Franklin Mint, Danbury Mint, and Bradford Exchange were three big names in the collector plate industry.</p>
<p>Consumers flocked to collector plates because the collectibles possessed decorative value. Frenzied buyers also purchased the collector plates for their perceived investment potential.</p>
<p>Instead of appreciating, however, the plates lost much of their worth in the 1990s. In the 21st century, a Hummel plate often sells for $10 or less on online auction sites. However, the oldest plates are still sought-after collectibles that command better prices.</p>
<h3>Recent Upswings</h3>
<p>Though the collector plate market has experienced a downturn in recent years, certain collector plates have begun to recoup their value. This is due mainly to baby boomers. Older buyers are drawn to the plates, especially Hummel plates, for nostalgic reasons.</p>
<h2>Hummel Plates Price Guide</h2>
<p>To find up-to-date prices for specific Hummel plates, view online auction “Sold” prices. You should also refer to a Hummel reference book for comparison.</p>
<h3>eBay “Sold” Prices</h3>
<p>To find eBay “Sold” Prices for a specific Hummel plate, click the “Advanced” tab to the right of the blue search bar. Type in the specific plate series and model, and select “Collector Plates.” Click “Sold Listings” and “Search.”</p>

<h2>Major Hummel Plates Series</h2>
<p>Some Hummel plate collectors aren’t aware that Hummel issued eight major plate series from 1971 to 1995. Most of the series feature full-size plates, although two series showcase smaller mini-plates. It is a collector’s dream to have all the plates from one series. The first step in finding an entire plate series is to know what you’re looking for!</p>
