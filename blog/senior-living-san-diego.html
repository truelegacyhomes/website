<p>The United States senior population continues to grow rapidly. Extended life spans are becoming the norm, and more baby boomers are retiring every day. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that by 2030, older adults will make up nearly <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/factsheets/promoting-health-for-older-adults.htm#:~:text=The%20increase%20in%20the%20number,nearly%2025%25%20of%20the%20population." target="_blank" rel="noopener">25 percent</a> of the United States population. An impressive number of these seniors are actively designing their retirement living experience.</p>
<p>California’s San Diego County has experienced the same senior population growth trend on a smaller scale. The appealing San Diego weather and healthy lifestyle have likely attracted older adults from all across the country. As a result, there is an increased focus on senior living San Diego style.</p>
<p>These new arrivals join other seniors who are searching for senior living communities and assisted living facilities. Keep reading to view 150 San Diego County communities that are worth consideration. Plus, we discuss the different senior living options and how to afford San Diego senior living.</p>
<h2>Why Retirees Enjoy the San Diego Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Retirees enjoy living in San Diego senior living communities for a number of reasons. The year-round pleasant weather presents an attractive backdrop for <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/activities-for-seniors/">many recreational activities</a>. Widespread beach access and numerous walking trails beckon outdoors enthusiasts of all ages.</p>
<p>The region also contains plenty of cultural offerings and entertainment venues. The San Diego Zoo Safari Park, San Diego Botanic Garden, and Balboa Park are just a few of the area’s attractions.</p>
<p>Retirees who like to sample diverse cuisines will find plenty of tasty options. Whether you prefer fine-dining restaurants or eclectic street food, there are enough choices to satisfy adventurous palates.</p>
<p>In many cases, older adults choose a retirement destination based on the availability of top-tier medical care. Fortunately, the San Diego area is host to many world-class hospitals and medical practitioners.</p>
<h2>Senior Living Options</h2>
<p>There are two main types of senior living options in San Diego: senior living communities and retirement homes. Both senior housing choices offer residents a pleasant setting for a vibrant, satisfying lifestyle. We’ll briefly cover both types of retirement living.</p>
<h3>About Senior Living Communities</h3>
<p>Older adults looking for independent living options often gravitate to senior living communities. Independent living communities cater to healthy adults who generally don’t need assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs). Therefore, the facility usually doesn’t offer medical or nursing care, although residents can hire their own assistants if necessary. Included in independent living communities are <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/continuing-care-retirement-communities/">continuing care communities</a>. With continuing care communities, there are multiple senior living options in one place.</p>
<p>A typical senior living in a San Diego senior living community enjoys a spacious campus, diverse housing options, and various floor plans. Residents may choose from freestanding homes, duplexes, cottages, condominiums, or apartment homes. Outdoor amenities often include courtyards and walking trails. Some facilities may even offer swimming pools and tennis courts.</p>
<p>Communities typically have a clubhouse or recreation center where they host college or continuing education classes, movie nights, holiday get-togethers, and other special events. Plus, many San Diego senior living communities also offer spas and hair salons.</p>
<h3>Retirement Homes</h3>
<p>A retirement home, or <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/assisted-living-vs-nursing-homes/">assisted living community,</a> is often a good choice for seniors who might otherwise require some degree of home-based care. Assisted living residents typically need help with one or more activities of daily living. Examples include personal hygiene, continence assistance, medication monitoring, and meal consumption.</p>
<p>Retirement homes in San Diego include individual homes, duplexes, condominiums, and cottages. Senior apartments and low-income senior housing may also be viable living options. Many assisted living communities offer a memory care or Alzheimer’s unit. These dedicated facilities provide healthcare for residents with cognitive decline issues.</p>
<p>A typical senior living in a San Diego retirement community enjoys large common areas, a full slate of recreational activities, and a restaurant-style dining room. Assisted living residents frequently enjoy shopping and cultural event outings. And on holidays and special occasions, community groups and musicians engage residents with lively performances.</p>
<h2>Affording San Diego Senior Living</h2>
<p>Before you or your loved one can move into a San Diego retirement community, you’ll need to consider how you will afford it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/medicare-assisted-living/">Medicare does not</a> usually cover the cost of independent or assisted living facilities. If you own your home, you can sell it to fund your new lifestyle.</p>
<p>Before you put your home on the market, you’ll need to liquidate most of your possessions. Fortunately, a professionally managed estate sale is an ideal way to accomplish that goal. If you haven’t visited one before, <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-sales/">find an estate sale</a> in your area to learn how these events work.</p>
<p>In just a few days, <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/">an estate sale company</a> can organize and conduct a successful sale. The estate sale’s profits will help fund your new lifestyle. Plus, the sale will pass unnecessary items on to someone else. You’ll receive peace of mind, and you’ll be able to turn your focus to making the most of the next chapter of your life.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Community for You</h2>
<p>To find a senior living or assisted living community that satisfies your needs, identify the “must have” services and amenities.</p>
<p>These are the items that you’re not willing to live without. At the same time, create a second-tier list of desirable community attributes. These are items that you’d like to have, but it won’t be a deal breaker if a facility doesn’t offer them.</p>
<p>Once you find the right senior community, make the commitment and begin transitioning to your new home. Determine your moving timeline, and work with the community’s admissions director to coordinate the necessary logistics. And, remember to choose the items you want to bring along with you.</p>
<p>Finding the right San Diego senior living community is all about research. Be sure to tour the facilities and talk to current residents. You deserve to age in style, with comfort, perfect weather, and beautiful views. One of these 150 San Diego senior communities will be sure to have all of that and more.</p>
