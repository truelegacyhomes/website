<h2><b>Information for Shoppers</b></h2>
<p><span>Shopping </span><a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/what-is-an-estate-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>estate sales San Diego </span></a><span>can be a lot of fun and a great way to find hidden gems!

<h2><b>How does one handle hoarding?</b></h2>
<p><span>Hoarding has been diagnosed as a form of mental illness. There’s so much depth to it, and a few major categories of people. There are doomsdayers who keep stocking up on supplies and food, and older people who can’t bear to get rid of something potentially useful — even paper plates or sugar packets — and baby boomers buying collectibles like baseball cards, comic books, toys.</span> <span>(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/garden/hoarding-help-consultant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>)</span></p>
<p><span>If you are dealing with the results of a hoarder and do not even know where to begin, we understand! It can quickly become very overwhelming when you are trying to sort through piles of what to you is garbage and what was, to them, priceless. Estate sales can be a great way to organize and sell some of these belongings. If you need more time or energy to devote to this type of big project, contact our team at True Legacy Homes! We specialize in estate sales and are readily equipped to sort through all the items and stage them in a way that appeals to potential buyers! We take care of the entire process for you, from start to finish! If that sounds appealing, we would love to help you! Call us, and we will contact you to schedule a meeting! </span></p>
<h2><b>Why plan an estate sale?</b></h2>
<p><span>Several situations call for an estate sale. The first is a situation like that which was described above</span><span>. If you are dealing with the leftovers of a hoarder, the easiest solution may be to bring people in to organize and sell all the leftover belongings. </span></p>
<p><span>If you are dealing with the death of a loved one, you may want to consider hosting an estate sale to clear the property of their belongings so that you can sell the property. Additionally, if you are moving and cannot take everything with you, an estate sale is a great method that you can use to get rid of a lot of the excess items. </span></p>
<h2><b>How does the sale work?</b></h2>
<p><span>First, we walk through the property with you to determine which items you plan on keeping and which items you wish to sell. After that has been established, we will stage the home to encourage shopping. We create an exciting environment for shoppers and stage the items to make them more appealing to potential buyers. </span></p>
<p><span>We will then price the items according to their value while marking them at a competitive rate that will attract buyers. We will also have an appraiser price some of the more valuable and specialized items. During the final walkthrough, if you find that an item you would like to keep has been priced for sale, you can take it during this time. </span></p>
<p><span>When it comes to the sale weekend, we will execute the sale so that you can be here during the weekend. We keep receipts so that you can see what is going on at all times, and if you have any questions, we can provide you with answers. We prioritize open communication so that you always stay well-informed.</span></p>
<p><span>After the sale, you will have another chance to walk through and remove any items left over. We will go through and donate the remaining items so that you do not have to worry about dealing with them. After the home has been empty, we clean the place up for you. You will receive the funds and receipts.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Benefits Come With Working With True Legacy Homes?</b></h2>
<p><span>Many benefits come with hiring an estate sale planner, specifically one as great as True Legacy Homes.</span></p>

We also provide you with receipts and strive for open communication with you at all times. We encourage questions and are always here to answer them in the best way that we possibly can!
