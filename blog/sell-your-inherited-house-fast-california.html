<p>True Legacy Homes (TLH) offers a unique Cash Home Offer program tailored for estate properties and senior transitions. In simple terms, TLH will buy your inherited house directly for cash – no listing on the market, no repairs, no showings, and no fees. It’s a one-stop solution: TLH handles everything from valuation to clean-out, so you can “skip straight to the sale” and settle the estate quickly. Here are the key features at a glance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell “As-Is” – No Repairs or Cleaning: You don’t need to fix anything or even empty the house. TLH buys the home in its current condition, whether it’s dated, cluttered, or needs work. You can leave unwanted items behind and TLH will take care of removal and clean-out.</li>
<li>No Showings or Open Houses: The sale is private and off-market. There’s no parade of strangers coming through the home. This means less stress and more privacy for your grieving family.</li>
<li>No Realtor Commissions or Closing Costs: TLH does not charge you real estate commissions, and often they cover standard closing costs. This can save around 5–6% of the price (the typical agent fee in a traditional sale). There are also no escrow fees or hidden charges – the price offered is generally the net you receive.</li>
<li>Fast Closing (Often 10 Days or Less): A cash sale to TLH can close in as little as 7–14 days. There’s no waiting for buyer loan approvals or lengthy escrow delays. You choose the closing date that works for you – whether you need fast cash or extra time to transition.</li>
<li>Certainty & No Contingencies: TLH’s offer is a firm cash offer with no contingencies – meaning they won’t back out due to inspections or financing, and they won’t ask you for repairs last-minute. Once you accept, consider it a done deal with a guaranteed closing date.</li>
<li>Estate Sale & Clean-Out Services (Optional): Uniquely, TLH can also coordinate an estate sale for the contents of the home and a thorough property clean-out. In fact, they offer a bundling discount if you use their estate sale services along with the home sale. This means one team can help you sell the household items and buy the house, simplifying the entire process.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the TLH Cash Offer program is geared toward families in transition who value speed, simplicity, and compassion over squeezing out every last dollar. It lets you cash out the home quickly so you can focus on what matters – honoring your loved one’s memory and getting back to family.</p>
<p>Benefits of a TLH Cash Offer: True Legacy Homes makes it easy to sell an inherited home by buying it “as-is” for cash. Families can avoid the hassles of repairs, showings, and fees, and close on their own timeline. TLH often bundles estate sale services to help clear out belongings, providing a one-stop solution (testimonial from a San Diego client: “True Legacy removed all of that burden… I’m forever grateful”).</p>
<h3>Step 1: Free Consultation and Initial Contact</h3>
<p>The first step is simple – reach out to TLH for a free consultation. You can call them or schedule a phone consult online. A TLH representative will then:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to Your Situation: They’ll ask about the property address, who the decision makers are (e.g. multiple siblings, a trustee, etc.), and what you’re looking to accomplish. This is a relaxed conversation to understand your needs and timeline. There’s no obligation and no pressure.</li>
<li>Explain the Process: TLH will walk you through how their cash offer works and answer any upfront questions. For example, if the home is still full of personal belongings or needs major repairs, they’ll reassure you that you don’t have to clean or fix anything – they truly mean as-is. If the property is in probate or a trust, they may ask about the legal status (more on probate specifics later).</li>
<li>Schedule a Home Visit (Evaluation): If it sounds like a fit, the next step is to schedule a visit to the property for an evaluation. Often this can be done within a day or two of your initial call, at a time convenient for you. If you’re located out of the area or unable to be there in person, TLH can coordinate with a local contact or even do a virtual walkthrough in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: Before the consultation call, it helps to gather any basic info about the house (year built, square footage, any major issues you know of) and documents like the trust or will (if applicable) or court appointment of executor. Don’t worry if you don’t have everything – TLH’s team is experienced with estates and can guide you on what they’ll need.</p>
<h3><a></a>Step 2: Home Evaluation and Fair Market Analysis</h3>
<p>Next, TLH will perform an evaluation of the property. This usually involves an on-site visit by a TLH acquisitions specialist, which is essentially a quick walkthrough of the home. Here’s what happens in this step:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-Site Walkthrough: A TLH team member will meet you at the house (or arrange access). They’ll take a look at the home’s condition, layout, and contents. Don’t stress about mess or clutter! They expect many estate homes to be full of belongings or a bit outdated – that’s normal. No need to clean up for them. This visit is typically fairly short, maybe 30-60 minutes.</li>
<li>Property Analysis: Behind the scenes, TLH’s acquisitions team uses a data-driven valuation method to determine a fair cash offer. They look at comparable sales in the neighborhood, the home’s features (bedrooms, lot size, etc.), and even calculate estimated renovation costs. Essentially, they evaluate the home “like an appraiser would” to come up with what they call a “True Legacy Appraisal” value for your home. This ensures the offer is grounded in market reality.</li>
<li>Considering Your Needs: TLH will also factor in any special considerations you discussed. For example, if you need extra time before moving out, or if you plan to conduct an estate sale first, those may influence the proposed timeline or structure of their offer. They pride themselves on being flexible with closing dates and possession to accommodate families in transition.</li>
<li>No Obligation: Importantly, this evaluation and analysis is free and carries no obligation. TLH is essentially doing their homework so they can present you with a solid offer. You haven’t committed to anything yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the evaluation, TLH usually can move quickly. In many cases, they can prepare a written cash offer within 24-48 hours of the home visit. Sometimes even sooner – some clients get an offer the same day as the walkthrough for straightforward cases. The next step is reviewing that offer.</p>
<h3><a></a>Step 3: Cash Offer Presentation and Decision</h3>
<p>Once TLH has completed their analysis, they will present you with a cash offer for the property. This step is often surprisingly fast and straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiving the Offer: A TLH representative will contact you to share the proposed purchase price and terms. They often provide a written offer document for you to review (via email or in person). The offer will outline the cash price, an expected closing date (which can be flexible as per your needs), and the fact that it’s as-is with no contingencies. Remember, there are no realtor commissions deducted, and TLH typically covers standard escrow fees, so the price is effectively your net proceeds.</li>
<li>Offer Review & Questions: Take the time you need to review the offer. TLH is very open about how they arrived at their number. They may even show you some comparable sales and a net sheet to illustrate how the cash offer stacks up against a traditional sale net of fees. Feel free to ask questions: “How did you calculate this price?”, “Is this amount firm?”, “What if we find something major wrong later?” (Their answer will likely be that they’ve already accounted for repairs/renovations in their number – they won’t reduce it later or ask for fixes).</li>
<li>No-Pressure Environment: The offer is no-obligation. You are not locked in until you sign a contract. TLH understands this is a big decision and will never pressure you to decide on the spot. They often encourage families to compare their cash offer with what an agent might sell the home for, so you can make an informed choice. In fact, having a solid cash offer in hand gives you a helpful benchmark, even if you do consider listing the home.</li>
<li>Decision Time – Accept or Decline: If you decide the TLH cash offer meets your needs, fantastic – you can move forward to opening escrow (Step 4). If you decide not to accept, that’s okay too. The offer typically remains on the table for a period of time if you change your mind. Many families ultimately choose the TLH offer for the certainty and convenience it provides, even if it might be slightly below a hypothetical top-market price, because it avoids months of hassle. As one seller put it, “Their cash offer was very fair” for the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-World Example: One family in San Diego had several siblings inheriting a home that needed a lot of repairs. After seeing TLH’s cash offer, they compared the net they’d get versus a traditional sale. Between saving on agent fees and not having to carry the house for months, the difference in net cash was minimal. They accepted the offer and closed 10 days later, breathing a sigh of relief. “True Legacy removed all of that burden from me… I’m forever grateful,” one sister noted.</p>
<p>If you accept the offer, TLH will move into action quickly to make the closing process smooth. Let’s look at how the closing works.</p>
<h2><a></a>Step 4: Escrow and Closing (Get Your Cash Fast)</h2>
<p>After you accept TLH’s offer, the focus shifts to paperwork and closing details. TLH handles almost everything at this stage, but here’s what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening Escrow: TLH will open escrow with a reputable escrow/title company (a neutral third party that handles the transaction). If you’re not familiar with escrow, don’t worry – TLH and the escrow officer will guide you. Essentially, you’ll sign a purchase agreement (if not already signed when accepting the offer) and escrow instructions. Since this is a cash deal, there’s no lender involved to complicate things.</li>
<li>Title and Probate Considerations: The escrow/title company will do a title search to ensure the property’s title is clear. If the property was held in a trust or you are the executor, you’ll need to provide the trust documents or court-issued letters of administration. TLH is experienced with estate sales, so they can even coordinate with your probate attorney if any court filings or approvals are needed. (See the next section for more on probate scenarios.)</li>
<li>No Contingency Surprises: Unlike a typical buyer, TLH won’t be scheduling home inspections or appraisals that you have to accommodate. Their offer is non-contingent – meaning they’re not going to back out barring some extremely unforeseen title issue. This gives you peace of mind that the sale will go through on time.</li>
<li>Choose Your Closing Date: One big advantage is flexibility. If you want to close as soon as possible, TLH can often close in a week or 10 days after escrow is opened. If you need a bit more time (perhaps to finish an estate sale or just emotionally prepare), TLH can schedule closing a few weeks out. They have even allowed sellers to remain in the home for a short period after closing in special cases, via rent-back arrangements. The goal is to make the transition comfortable for you.</li>
<li>Final Walkthrough & Moving Out: Typically, you’ll only need to clear out the items you want to keep. Anything you don’t want can be left for TLH to handle. They have said families can leave behind personal belongings and “TLH [will handle] the entire clean-out later”. This is a huge relief – you don’t need to rent a dumpster or pay for junk hauling. If you’re utilizing TLH’s estate sale service, they will likely conduct the estate sale before closing (or coordinate the timing with you), so that the valuables are sold and the remaining items can be disposed or donated, all by their team.</li>
<li>Signing Documents: In a California real estate closing, the sellers (that’s you, as executor or trustee) will sign the grant deed and a few other documents, usually in front of a notary. TLH’s escrow officer will guide you through this. If you’re out-of-state, they can arrange a mobile notary to come to you. It’s a short signing appointment since there’s no loan paperwork on your side.</li>
<li>Receive Payment: On the day of closing (the date you set), the sale is finalized. The escrow company will either wire the funds directly to your account or issue a cashier’s check for the sale proceeds. The property is officially sold, and TLH will take ownership from that point. Congratulations – you’ve converted the inherited house to cash!</li>
</ul>
<p>Closing an estate home through TLH is often remarkably quick and smooth. Many families are amazed that from the first call to money-in-hand can be done in around 10 days without them having to lift a finger on repairs or showings. Next, we’ll address some special situations like probate and multiple heirs, because we know every family’s case is unique.</p>

<p>Every inheritance situation is different. You might be dealing with a living trust, a will going through probate court, or co-heirs who all have a stake. The TLH Cash Offer process can accommodate these scenarios. Here’s how:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the Property Is in a Trust: Good news – if the home was owned by a living trust, you likely can sell without court involvement. The successor trustee (perhaps you) has authority to sell the property per the trust terms. TLH will simply need a copy of the trust and any trustee authorization documents. The sale process is essentially the same as described above, just with the trustee signing on behalf of the trust. Since trust administration is private, a quick cash sale to TLH can wrap up the trust efficiently and privately.</li>
<li>If the Estate Is in Probate: Many inherited homes do end up in probate court, but TLH is very familiar with probate sales. First, determine if the executor has “full authority” under the Independent Administration of Estates Act (IAEA) – this is usually granted in California unless the will restricts it. With full authority, an executor can accept an offer and sell the property without a court hearing, just by giving notice to interested parties. In this case, a TLH sale can close quickly (often just waiting for a 15-day notice period to run). If court confirmation is required (limited authority), the TLH team can still make an offer and even attend the court hearing to get it approved. They are used to handling “probate or trust complications… with professionalism and tact”. Essentially, TLH will work hand-in-hand with your probate attorney to ensure all legal steps are followed. While probate might add some weeks to the timeline, having TLH lined up as a buyer can prevent further delays (and avoid having to list the home on the open market for auction).</li>
<li>Multiple Heirs or <a href="https://www.tresplaw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decision Maker</a>s: If there are several siblings or beneficiaries who need to agree on the sale, TLH can accommodate that too. It’s usually best if one person is designated (by the court or trust) to sign documents (executor or trustee), but TLH is happy to meet with or speak to all the family members so everyone’s on the same page. They can even set up a group meeting or Zoom call to present the offer to everyone and address concerns. Transparency is key – they will patiently explain how they arrived at the price and how the process works so that each heir feels comfortable. Once the family decides to proceed, the authorized representative will sign the sale documents, and each heir will receive their share of the proceeds after closing per the estate plan. Many families find that a quick sale reduces friction among heirs – it turns a complex asset (a house that someone has to manage) into divisible cash fast, which can prevent disputes.</li>
<li>Occupied Homes or Assisted Living Transitions: Sometimes the inherited home is still occupied by a surviving spouse or an elderly parent who is moving to assisted living. TLH’s flexibility shines here. They can, for example, close on the home and allow Mom or Dad to continue living there for an agreed period until their new residence is ready. This scenario often comes up when seniors need funds for long-term care – TLH provides the cash and a convenient move-out timeline so the transition is smooth for all involved.</li>
<li>Hoarder Homes or Extensive Clutter: In cases where the property is extremely cluttered (perhaps the loved one was a hoarder or simply accumulated decades of stuff), know that TLH has seen it all. They will still buy the home as-is and handle the clean-out. Such houses would be very hard to sell traditionally, but TLH specializes in making it easy for the family. No amount of clutter will scare them off! They truly mean it when they say “any home in any condition.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Important: Always consult with your attorney or legal advisor about the proper procedure if you’re in probate. TLH’s team will not replace legal counsel, but they have experience to guide you on what typically needs to happen. The big takeaway is that a TLH cash sale is compatible with probate and trust rules in California. In fact, by going with TLH, you may avoid the need for an open-market sale that requires more court oversight. It streamlines the estate settlement.</p>
<h2><a></a>TLH Cash Offer vs. Traditional Home Sale</h2>

<p>You might be wondering how a TLH cash offer compares to selling the home the usual way (hiring a realtor, fixing it up, and listing on the MLS). Let’s break down the differences in timeline, costs, and outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed of Sale: A traditional sale often takes months. You might spend 30-60 days preparing the house (estate sale, repairs, cleaning), then 30-45 days in escrow with a buyer’s loan – it could be 2-3+ months to close. With a TLH cash offer, you set the pace. Escrow can be as short as 7–14 days (or longer if you need). It’s not uncommon to go “from first conversation to closed sale in under two weeks”. That speed can be critical if the estate needs funds or you simply want to move on quickly.</li>
<li>Preparing the Property: In a traditional sale, significant effort and money may go into making the home presentable. Families often must declutter, hold an estate sale, make repairs, paint, clean, stage – essentially treat it like a project to fetch top dollar. This is time-consuming and overwhelming for heirs, especially if you don’t live nearby or the home is in rough shape. With TLH, there is no prep needed. You literally can skip all the cleaning and fixing. TLH buys as-is, and even says you can leave behind unwanted items for them to handle. This saves you not only stress but also out-of-pocket costs on repairs/updates.</li>
<li>Showings and Marketing: A traditional sale means listing the house publicly, putting up a sign, and having buyers trooping through for showings and open houses. This can feel invasive – remember, it’s not just a property, it’s your family home full of memories. There’s also uncertainty; you may get tire-kickers or lowball offers. With a TLH sale, there are no showings at all. It’s a discreet, private transaction. Only the TLH team evaluates the house. No nosy neighbors or bargain hunters will be peeking in the closets. This privacy can spare a family a lot of emotional discomfort during a difficult time.</li>
<li>Offer Uncertainty: Even if you find a buyer traditionally, their offer will likely come with contingencies – inspections, appraisal, financing approval. Any of these can derail the deal (for instance, an inspection might uncover issues and the buyer might demand repairs or drop out). There’s often back-and-forth negotiations and the risk of escrow falling apart. In contrast, TLH provides a non-contingent cash offer. There are no inspections or appraisal contingencies. They won’t ask you for credits or repairs. This certainty is priceless: once you sign, you can rest assured the sale will close on time without last-minute surprises.</li>
<li>Costs and Net Proceeds: On the surface, a traditional sale might fetch a higher price – especially if the market is hot, you might get multiple offers. However, you have to subtract the 5-6% agent commissions, closing costs, and any repair or improvement expenses you incurred. You also have to factor in the “holding costs” if it takes months – property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, utilities, etc., which the estate keeps paying until closing. With TLH, while the offer price might be a bit lower than a perfect-market scenario, you have $0 in repairs, $0 in seller fees, and you cut out months of carrying costs. Often, when families do the math, the net cash in hand is comparable or even better with the TLH route. And you get that cash now instead of much later. Essentially, you’re trading a small amount of potential upside for a guaranteed, quick outcome – a swap many estate executors find well worth it.</li>
<li>Emotional Toll: Selling a beloved family home through a traditional process can be an emotional rollercoaster. Strangers picking through rooms during open houses, the home sitting on the market with uncertainty, and the family having to keep revisiting the property to maintain it can prolong grief. An off-market sale to TLH is far more private and controlled, which can make it emotionally easier. There’s no “For Sale” sign on the lawn and no public marketing, so you avoid turning the home into a public spectacle. TLH’s team also understands the sensitivity; their motto is “Estate Sales with Dignity,” and they handle these sales with compassion.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, a TLH Cash Offer prioritizes speed, certainty, and convenience, whereas a traditional sale aims for top dollar but comes with delay, work, and risk. Each family must decide what’s best for them, but if you value a quick, low-stress resolution, TLH’s model is a compelling option. The peace of mind knowing the sale is guaranteed and the burden lifted can be “more valuable… than an extra $20k” in price might be in many cases.</p>
<p>The burden of a traditional sale vs. the ease of a TLH Cash Offer. Left: All the steps and costs a family faces when listing an inherited home (estate sale, repairs, finding an agent, showings, negotiations, paying commissions, etc.). Right: With TLH, most of these burdens disappear – no repairs, no showings, no fees, and a fast closing. The comparison often shows that the net outcome (what you walk away with) is similar, but achieved with far less stress and time.</p>

<p>One standout benefit of working with True Legacy Homes is that they can handle much more than just buying the house. TLH is also a leading estate sale company in Southern California, which means they can help you liquidate the personal property inside the home – the furniture, collections, vehicles, etc. – and clear out the house, all as part of the service. Here’s how this works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional Estate Sale: If your family home is filled with decades of belongings and you want to sell those items, TLH can run an estate sale for you. They have professionals who will organize, appraise, and conduct a sale of the household items right there at the property. They advertise to their network of buyers/collectors to ensure a good turnout. This saves you the enormous task of trying to sell items yourself or hire a separate liquidator. TLH’s estate sale team is known for handling everything with respect – “Estate Sales with Dignity” is not just a slogan, it’s how they operate, making sure your loved one’s possessions are treated with care.</li>
<li>Donations & Disposal: After the estate sale, there are usually some remaining items. TLH will coordinate donating usable items to charities and hauling away the rest as trash. You do not have to personally clean out the house – their crew will leave the property broom-clean. This clean-out can often be done within a couple of days after the sale.</li>
<li>Bundling with Home Sale: If TLH is also buying the house, they typically bundle these services together. In fact, they often provide a discount or credit so that the cost (or commission) of the estate sale is reduced when combined with the home sale. From your perspective, that means more money in the estate’s pocket. It also means you’re dealing with one coordinated team for both selling the contents and selling the house, which simplifies communication tremendously.</li>
<li>One Team, Smoother Transition: The same TLH coordinator can schedule the estate sale before closing on the house, so the timeline flows logically. For example, you might accept the cash offer, then the following week TLH’s team holds the estate sale over a weekend, and the next week you close escrow on the house. By bundling, “the family earns money from the estate sale, and if TLH is buying the house too, they often bundle the services to give the family a discount on the clean-out”. It’s a win-win. The family gets max value for personal property and an easy home sale.</li>
<li>No Double Coordination: Without a service like TLH’s, an executor might have to hire an estate sale company, wait for that process, then separately hire a realtor or investor for the house – juggling two processes. TLH’s integrated approach means less scheduling and fewer headaches for you. As the guide for realtors noted, “one team handles everything”, which is a “tremendous value-add” for overwhelmed sellers.</li>
<li>Optional Service: If you already removed all belongings or prefer to handle items yourself, you are not required to use the estate sale service. It’s there as an option. Some families, for instance, keep important heirlooms and then donate the rest without a sale – which TLH can also assist with by arranging a clean-out crew. The key is, whatever the situation with the contents, TLH likely has a solution to help.</li>
</ul>
<p>By utilizing TLH’s estate sale and clean-out services, families often feel a huge weight lifted. A home filled with memories is not easy to empty, but having experienced professionals do it for you, while monetizing those items for the estate, can turn a daunting task into a manageable one. And when combined with the quick home sale, it truly provides a one-stop, fast-track inheritance solution.</p>

<p>Selling a family home, especially after a loss, isn’t just a business transaction – it’s an emotional journey. True Legacy Homes understands this deeply. Their approach is centered on support, dignity, and reducing stress for your family:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Supportive, Empathetic Team: From the first call, TLH’s staff will treat you with kindness and understanding. They know you might be grieving or overwhelmed. As CEO Paul Williamson put it in a letter to families, “we completely empathize with these feelings… we take the stress and burden out of selling your home so you can get back to what matters most – family.” Every step of the way, their goal is to lift the burden off your shoulders.</li>
<li>No-Stress Process: The whole design of the Cash Offer program is to minimize stress on you. By handling the hard parts (repairs, clean-out, paperwork) and offering a sure, fast outcome, TLH allows you to focus on your family and healing. There’s no prolonged uncertainty or living in limbo for months. Many clients express immense relief, as if a weight has been taken off. “I was overwhelmed… True Legacy removed all of that burden from me,” said one client in her testimonial.</li>
<li>Privacy and Dignity: Because TLH’s sale is private, you won’t have neighbors gossiping about an estate sale sign or buyers nitpicking your loved one’s decor. TLH often doesn’t even put up a For Sale sign. The process is quiet and dignified. One family noted that TLH made “the last memory of our home so nice that we were actually able to have closure and walk away”. Instead of a drawn-out sale tarnishing the memory of the home, TLH helped them end on a positive note.</li>
<li>Certainty in a Difficult Time: Grief and estate settling come with enough uncertainties; the sale of the house doesn’t have to be another. With TLH, you get certainty – a guaranteed buyer, a fixed timeline, and clear communication. That peace of mind can reduce a lot of anxiety for you and your relatives. You won’t be lying awake at night worried if the buyer’s loan will fall through or if you’ll have to drop the price.</li>
<li>Respect for Your Family’s Legacy: TLH’s slogan, “Estate Sales with Dignity,” extends to how they treat the home and its contents. They take care in sorting items, often finding and setting aside personal treasures or important documents they come across for the family. Their estate sale team tries to ensure beloved items find appreciative new homes. This respectful handling can provide comfort – knowing your parent’s possessions weren’t just tossed aside, but rehomed or donated thoughtfully.</li>
<li>Real People, Real Praise: TLH has helped over 2,000+ families to date. The feedback is overwhelmingly positive. We’ve already shared a few quotes from past clients: Alison (who praised their fairness and burden-lifting) and Kathy (who found closure through TLH’s help). These are not just one-off cases – many families echo similar sentiments. TLH’s website and reviews are full of stories of gratitude from relieved sellers. Knowing that others in your shoes had a successful, supportive experience can give you confidence that you’re making a wise choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, TLH’s service is about helping families through one of life’s toughest transitions with ease and compassion. You’re not just selling a house; you’re closing a chapter. TLH strives to make that closing chapter as smooth and positive as it can be, so you can move forward without regrets.</p>

<p>Before you decide on moving forward with a TLH Cash Offer, use this quick checklist to ensure you’re ready and to get the most out of the process:</p>
<p>1. Gather Key Documents: Locate the will or trust documents that show who has authority to sell (executor nomination, trust trustee page, etc.). If probate has been filed, have the court order or letters naming the executor/administrator. Also, find the property deed if available and any mortgage info (though TLH can get this in escrow, knowing the payoff amount helps).</p>
<p>2. Identify Decision Makers: Clarify who needs to be involved in the decision. Discuss with siblings or co-heirs ahead of time that you plan to explore a cash sale. It’s ideal to have family alignment on selling the home. If multiple people will be on calls, let TLH know so they can include everyone.</p>
<p>3. Decide on Contents Handling: Make a game plan for personal property. Are there specific heirlooms to keep? Which items might you want to sell vs. donate? You don’t need an exact list, but an idea helps. TLH can then tailor their service (estate sale or just clean-out) to your needs.</p>
<p>4. Consider Your Timeline: Think about any external deadlines. Do you need funds by a certain date? Are there tax or legal timelines (estate tax, probate closing, care home move-in dates)? Or maybe no rush at all? Knowing your ideal timeframe will help you and TLH set the closing date. Remember, TLH is flexible – they can close fast or give you a bit longer, as you prefer.</p>
<p>5. Contact TLH for a Consultation: This is a no-lose step – you’ll get free information about your options. You can reach out via their website or phone and schedule a call. Have your questions ready. Common ones might be: “How exactly do you determine the offer?”, “Can we do an estate sale first?”, “What if some siblings can’t travel here?” – ask anything on your mind.</p>
<p>6. Review the Offer Carefully: When you receive TLH’s cash offer, take the time to review it in detail. Compare it to what you estimate a traditional sale net would be. TLH can help you with that comparison by outlining the costs you’d avoid. Ensure you understand terms like “as-is” and that there are no fees you’ll be charged (there shouldn’t be with TLH’s offer). If something is unclear, ask!</p>
<p>7. Consult Advisors if Needed: If you have a probate attorney or a trusted realtor friend, feel free to run the offer by them. Some families get a quick realtor opinion on what the home might fetch on the open market for comparison. TLH’s offer should already account for the needed fix-ups and fees, but getting that peace of mind can help your decision. (Many realtors, when honest, will acknowledge that an offer with no hassle and no commission can be very attractive for an estate.)</p>
<p>8. Plan the Logistics: Once you decide to accept, coordinate the practical stuff. For example, set a target closing date with TLH. Plan when you’ll remove personal items you’re keeping (often you can do this during the escrow period). If you’re doing an estate sale, schedule it with TLH’s team. Also, make sure you know where you want the sale proceeds wired (which bank account).</p>
<p>9. Communicate Openly: Keep in touch with your TLH representative and escrow officer. They’ll likely be in regular contact, but don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re unsure of something or if a family situation changes. The process is quick, but they’ll guide you through each step so you’re never in the dark.</p>
<p>10. Take a Breath – You’re Almost There: Remember that by choosing this route, you’ve spared yourself and your family a lot of potential heartache and work. As closing approaches, start collecting any last personal mementos from the house and saying your farewells to the property. It can be emotional, but look toward the future – the fast cash you gain can be used to pay off estate bills, invest for the family, or honor your loved one’s memory in other meaningful ways.</p>
<p>When you’ve ticked off these items, you’ll be well-prepared and informed. Fast-tracking an inheritance sale doesn’t mean skipping due diligence – it means handling the key tasks efficiently and leaning on professionals to do the heavy lifting.</p>
