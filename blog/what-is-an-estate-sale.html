<h2><b>What is an estate sale?</b></h2>
<p><span>An estate sale or estate liquidation is a sale or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>auction</span></a><span> to dispose of a substantial portion of the materials owned by a person who is recently deceased or who must dispose of their personal property to facilitate a move.</span> <span>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>)</span></p>
<p><span>So, to put i</span><span>t more simply, the goal of an estate sale is to sell all of your “stuff.” People have a lot of different reasons for needing to host an estate sale. This could be the sudden need for a big move when you do not have the time or resources to move your belongings across the country. This could also be due to the loss of a loved one. If you are left with their home and belongings, the best course of action is to host an estate sale so you can clean out the house in preparation for selling it. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why do people need an estate sale planner?</b></h2>
<p><span>As we mentioned, people often host estate sales when they need to liquidate assets due to a loss of a loved one or a big move where taking all of your belongings with you is unrealistic. Both of these things have in common that they are both very stressful situations that you find yourself in. </span></p>
<p><span>When you are in the midst of a painful or overwhelming experience, the last thing that you want to do is have to put in a lot of hard work to throw together an estate sale. Estate sales take a lot of time and effort to plan, and it can be hard to find the energy to put in that much work. </span></p>
<p><span>If you are not looking to invest that time and energy into a project but still need to host an estate sale, it may be time to look for an estate sale planner. The entire point of an estate sale planner is to take that weight off of your shoulders by organizing the sale for you. </span></p>
<h2><b>How long does the estate sale take?</b></h2>
<p><span>Typically, the estate sale process only takes a couple of days. In a typical week, we will start staging a sale on Tuesday and hosting the sale that weekend. How quickly we can get your sale done depends on how many sales we have to manage at a time.</span></p>
<h2><b>Our Process</b></h2>
<p><span>When you hire True Legacy to organize and manage your estate sale, you will receive a wide variety of services. To begin, we will walk through the property with you to get an idea of what we are working with. Throughout this process, we will take note of what items you plan on keeping and which items </span><span>you wish to sell. After that has been established, we will come in and stage the home in a way that encourages shopping. We create an exciting environment for shoppers and stage the items to make them more appealing to potential buyers. </span></p>
<p><span>We will then price the items, doing careful research to ensure that we price them according to their value while marking them at a competitive rate that will attract buyers. We will also have an appraiser price those items that require a closer, more trained eye. We will then walk through the property with you again so that you can see all of the work that has been done. If you find that an item that you would like to keep has been priced for sale, you can take it during this time. </span></p>
<p><span>Now it is time for the sale! We will manage the sale so that you do not have to be here throughout the whole weekend. We keep receipts so that you can see what is going on at all times, and if you have any questions, we can provide you with receipts. </span></p>
<p><span>After the sale, you and your family can remove any items you do not want to be donated. We will go through and donate the remaining items so that you do not have to worry about dealing with them. After the home has been empty, we clean the place up for you, leaving it looking better than it was when we arrived. You will receive the funds and full accounts of all of the transactions that took place.</span></p>
<h2><b>Policy of Transparency</b></h2>
<p><span>Here at True Legacy Homes, we have a strong policy of maintaining transparency with you throughout the entire process. We understand that we are handling a lot of assets and potentially large sums of money, so we ensure to provide you with receipts for the whole process. </span></p>
