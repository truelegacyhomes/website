<p>As the 21st century settles into its third decade, the United States senior population continues to increase in both urban and rural areas. The older adult population in Orange County, California matches that general trend. In fact, Orange County’s percentage of older adults is expected to become even larger in the coming years. And for a good reason! Retiring in this sunny Southern California region grants Orange County seniors several advantages.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for senior housing in Orange County for yourself or a loved one, these profiles of senior living choices may help. We’re covering an extensive list of Orange County senior housing options, based on map data. You’ll also learn about different senior care choices, how to fund these senior living options, and how to transition to a senior living community.</p>
<p>With 100 communities that include various amenities and care levels, you’re sure to find a senior living option that meets your or your loved one’s needs.</p>
<h2>United States Senior Population Growth Trends</h2>
<p>Throughout the 20th century, the United States 65+ population continued its steady growth. In 2011, this rate accelerated as baby boomers began reaching the 65-year milestone.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, older adult numbers are projected to skyrocket, with a 69% increase expected between 2020 and 2060. During that same time period, the 85+ population will nearly triple in numbers.</p>
<h3>Orange County Senior Population Trends</h3>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Orange County, California senior population is a microcosm of the United States numbers. Currently, there are over 450,000 seniors living in Orange County. Older adults make up 14.3% of the county’s total population. By 2045, that percentage is expected to increase to 17.3%.</p>
<h3>Advantages of Retiring in Orange County</h3>
<p>Seniors who choose to retire in Orange County enjoy four advantages. First, the region boasts warm, sunny weather throughout the year. Retirees from snowy, frigid regions will likely appreciate the Southern California climate. The area also offers many beautiful beaches, mountains, and other stunning natural landscapes.</p>
<p>Orange County also contains many wonderful communities—some with purpose-built senior living enclaves—within the county’s boundaries. Senior adults often enjoy proximity to shopping centers, restaurants, golf courses, and medical centers.</p>
<h2>Orange County Senior Living Choices</h2>
<p>Within the senior living and senior care field, you’ll find a colorful array of communities and amenities. Facility pricing arrangements also vary, with increased care needs generally leading to higher monthly service fees. The following are the six types of senior living options found in Orange County. Keep reading to learn about each one’s characteristics and appeal.</p>
<h3>Senior Living Communities</h3>
<p>These Orange County communities are generally designed for healthy older adults who are able to enjoy a low-maintenance, independent lifestyle. Residents can choose from retirement community housing options that include single-family homes, condominiums, duplexes, and cottages. Numerous community amenities, such as a pool and clubhouse, are often available.</p>
<p>These active lifestyle residents enjoy a veritable feast of wellness, social, and recreational activities. Independent seniors can also satisfy their intellectual curiosity by visiting nearby cultural attractions.</p>
<h3>Continuing Care Retirement Communities</h3>
<p>Healthy senior adults often reside in <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/continuing-care-retirement-communities/">Continuing Care Retirement Communities</a> (or CCRCs). Also known as “Life Plan Communities,” these facilities provide the full spectrum of care on a single campus.</p>
<p>Orange County seniors generally enter the community as healthy, active adults. They may transition to assisted living or nursing home care if their needs change. Many CCRCs also include a memory care and Alzheimer’s unit. Because CCRCs include all living options on the same campus, each resident can age in place without needing to relocate to another community.</p>
<h3>Senior Apartment Homes</h3>
<p>Maybe you’re looking for 55 and over rental communities in Orange County, California. These age-restricted communities are generally limited to senior adults who are 55+ or 62+ years of age. Most senior apartments in Orange County offer studios along with one- and two-bedroom units. However, a few complexes may offer units with an extra bedroom or den.</p>
<p>Senior apartment homes feature a number of senior-friendly amenities and conveniences, including shower grab bars and other safety enhancements. The 55+ apartments in Orange County, California may provide a clubhouse, pool, or other common-area perks. Residents may also enjoy planned social gatherings. Most senior apartment homes offer market-rate rentals.</p>
<h3>Affordable Senior Housing</h3>
<p>Seniors with low incomes or other financial constraints can choose from several affordable housing choices in Orange County.</p>
<p>Local public housing agencies coordinate the apartment rentals, which are frequently sponsored by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).</p>
<p>Other apartments offer subsidized rents or Section 8-based rental arrangements. Low income senior housing Orange County may be a viable option for budget-conscious seniors.</p>
<p>Affordable housing applicants must satisfy predetermined acceptance criteria, and they must often provide pertinent documentation along with their applications. Note that some low-income senior housing communities may open or close their waiting lists based on unit availability.</p>
<h3>Assisted Living</h3>
<p>Senior adults who need some degree of home care but don’t require ongoing skilled nursing services may opt for an assisted living facility. Also known as Orange County retirement homes, these vibrant communities offer numerous amenities.<br />
Residents also enjoy various social and recreational activities and outings. At the same time, residents receive help with their activities of daily living (ADLs). Overall, Orange County seniors in assisted living facilities experience a very good quality of life.</p>
<h3>Nursing Homes</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/assisted-living-vs-nursing-homes/">Compared to assisted living</a> residents, seniors who need ongoing custodial and medical care often reside in nursing homes. These specialty facilities provide residents with skilled nursing and healthcare services under a physician’s supervision.</p>
<p>Nursing homes also offer rehabilitation services for recently released hospital patients. Trained therapists frequently offer physical, occupational, or speech therapy upon orders from a resident’s physician.</p>
<p>Because nursing home residents aren’t generally able to leave the premises, the facility’s staff offers a regular calendar of onsite social and recreational events. In addition, performers and community groups frequently visit the facility throughout the year. And local churches may offer a rotation of onsite services every month.</p>
<h2>Funding Orange County Senior Living</h2>
<p>When you’re searching for funds to cover senior living expenses, don’t leave any stone unturned. You may have to combine multiple resources to pay for your senior living experience. By getting creative, and pursuing multiple avenues, you’re more likely to generate the funds you need.</p>
<h3>Health Insurance and Medicare</h3>
<p>First, know that many health insurance plans don’t cover long-term care services. This includes residential care delivered in an assisted living facility or nursing home.</p>
<p>You may wonder <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/medicare-assisted-living/">if Medicare pays</a> for assisted living. No, Medicare does not cover custodial care or residency expenses, which include assisted living costs. This applies to Medicare Part A, Medicare Part B, and Medicare Part C.</p>
<p>However, Medicare will pay for a resident’s health services as specified in their Medicare Beneficiary Agreement. A participating Medicare health professional must deliver the service, which must be deemed “medically necessary.”</p>
<h3>Personal Financial Resources</h3>
<p>This catch-all term includes money from savings and contributions from family members. Selling stocks and bonds is also a potential source of funds.</p>
<p>To sell fine jewelry, artwork, or other valuable collectibles, <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/">contact</a> an estate sale company. They’ll organize and host the sale, and provide you or your loved one with the sales proceeds afterward. After the company clears out the house, you’re free to sell the home, which can provide additional revenue.</p>
<p>Plus, estate sales can be a <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/downsizing-seniors/">great way to downsize</a>. If you’re wondering how estate sales work, be sure to visit a few. Also, be sure to choose a reputable estate sale <a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-liquidators/">liquidator</a> to help with your sale.</p>
<h4>Medicaid</h4>
<p>Maybe you or your loved one has limited financial resources and complies with low-income requirements. If so, the Medicaid program may pay for part or all of the nursing home expenses.</p>
<p>However, using Medicaid means that an applicant’s income and assets will be analyzed prior to program acceptance. If the applicant qualifies, Medicaid will cover 100% of the costs incurred at a Medicaid-approved nursing home.</p>
<p>Medicaid’s assisted living benefit differs by state, as this program is funded at both the federal and state levels. Although the federal government issues regulations, each state sets their own guidelines on providing help to assisted living residents.</p>
<h4>Supplemental Security Income Program</h4>
<p>The Supplemental Security Income (or SSI) Program provides assistance to blind, disabled, or aged people with no (or little) income. This federally funded program provides cash for basic necessities such as shelter, food, and clothing.</p>
<h4>Veterans’ “Aid and Attendance” Program</h4>
<p>Veterans and/or spouses may receive some help with assisted living community costs. This “Aid and Attendance” program is designed for veterans with service-linked injuries or disabilities, disabled veterans under a specific income threshold, and veterans’ surviving spouses.</p>
<h4>Long-Term Care Insurance</h4>
<p>Your existing long-term care insurance policy likely covers assisted living or nursing home services. However, long-term care insurance must have been purchased prior to needing the care.</p>
<h4>Specific Life Insurance Benefits</h4>
<p>Certain life insurance policies allow a policyholder to receive a tax-free advance on their existing death benefit. These funds are structured to help pay for long-term care expenses. Some insurance carriers stipulate that the policyholder must have a terminal illness to obtain the benefit, while other companies aren’t as strict with their policies.</p>
<h4>Reverse Mortgage</h4>
<p>If your loved one is mortgage-free (or is almost mortgage-free) a reverse mortgage may generate funds for assisted living costs.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the homeowner obtains their home equity cash value.</p>
<p>You can receive the payouts in monthly payments or in a lump sum. When the borrower passes away, the loan comes due. The home is often sold to generate the loan payoff amount.</p>
