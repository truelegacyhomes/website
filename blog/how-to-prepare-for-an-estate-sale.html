<h2><b>Estate Planner</b></h2>
<p><span>If you are looking for someone to plan </span><span><a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-sales/huntington-beach-ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estate sales in Huntington Beach</a>, </span><span>then True Legacy could be just what you are looking for! We plan estate sales in the southern California region, making the most of every sale we plan so that you can reap the rewards! True Legacy Homes exhibits all the qualities someone may want in an estate sale coordinator. There are so many reasons to hire an estate sale planner. To begin, they make your life significantly easier.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why are we seeing more estate sales?</b></h2>
<p><span>There are two primary causes for an estate sale. The first is when the owner of a property passes away. Often, the kin will host an estate sale to pass on any belongings that the friends and family do not wish to keep. This clears out the house so that it is ready to be sold. The second reason people frequently host estate sales is that they are making a big move and cannot take most of their belongings with them. It is much easier to sell stuff when you do not have to move it! </span><span>The pandemic ignited a surge in home buying that we haven’t seen since 2006. A rise in remote work opportunities, a desire to relocate to less densely populated areas, and a large percentage of the population entering retirement are just some of the reasons people are on the move. </span><span>(<a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/broker-news/network/5-tips-to-help-clients-prepare-for-estate-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1</a>)</span><span> An estate sale turns a house into a shopping experience for potential buyers, and it is our job here at True Legacy to optimize that space so </span><span>you can sell as many belongings as possible. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why should I hire an estate sale planner?</b></h2>
<p><span>There are many great reasons to consider hiring an estate sale planner! Typically, people need to host an estate sale when they are at a very stressful point in life. Whether that be the death of a loved one or a big move, it can easily become overwhelming. When you hire somebody to come in and manage the process for you, you remove a huge burden from your shoulders. We take care of the entire process from start to finish for you so that you can focus on the things that matter. If you are in the middle of handling an estate and are becoming overwhelmed, you may want to consider working with a coordinator. It will make your life so much easier, and the whole thing will be taken care of before you know it! Give us a call!</span></p>
<h2><b>What should I look for in a good estate sale planner?</b></h2>
<p><span>You may want to look for several things in an estate sale planner. You want them to be reliable and trustworthy. When working in estate sales, you are handling many items, some of which could be extremely valuable. After the sale, you are handling potentially large sums of money. You want this person to be transparent and someone that you can trust to handle the money. It is important to consider what you are looking for in an estate sale planner before you begin searching. That way, you can know what to look for when you begin your search. </span></p>
<h2><b>What is the difference between an estate sale and a garage?</b></h2>
<p><span>This is a question that we see appear quite frequently! When you think of a garage sale, you think of a Saturday in May after all of the spring cleaning and closet purging has come to an end. You think of families setting up outside their garages with old clothes and children’s toys. You think of small children runnin</span><span>g their lemonade stand, hoping to make a few dollars in spare change. These are either neighborhood-organized or individually organized-events that sell the items you do not want to store anymore. </span></p>
<p><span>An estate sale is essentially a garage sale on steroids. Rather than selling your children’s clothes from the previous year and the toys they have not touched since you painstakingly removed them from the box, you are selling the entire contents of a property. This could be anything from clothing to a refrigerator to trinkets to jewelry to furniture. If it is in a house, it can be sold. Of course, you can remove items that you wish to keep, but for the most part, everything is up for grabs!</span></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.truelegacyhomes.com/estate-sales/huntington-beach-ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Estate Sales Huntington Beach, CA</span></a></h2>
<p><span>Many people wonder how long it takes us to plan and organize an estate sale. Typically, we start work on a Tuesday with setting up everything. Sales typically occur over the weekend! It is a very short process, so it is all taken care of, and you can keep moving on to the next great phase in life! </span></p>
<h2>Why True Legacy?</h2>
<p><span>So, why should you choose to hire True Legacy when it comes to all of your estate sale planning needs? The answer is simple! We work hard so that you do not have to! We want you to be able to process the big life events happening, and we take care of all of the hard work for you! </span></p>
