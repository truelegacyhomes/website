## Frequently Asked Questions

### Estate Sales

**How is an estate sale different than a garage sale?**
An estate sale is basically a garage sale on steroids. Garage sales are great if you want to sell some items and make a few hundred bucks over a weekend. Estate sales are used when you want to sell all (or almost all) of the contents of a home—typically when a loved one passes or you need to downsize quickly.

**How many items do I need to have a sale?**
There are NO item minimums or limits. Even if you only have five items, give us a call.

**Does my family maintain access to the home?**
Yes. Your family has access throughout the entire process and is encouraged to walk through before and after the sale.

**After the estate sale, is my home completely empty?**
Yes. We use trash removal services and partnerships with the Salvation Army to donate remaining items. Your home will be completely empty and left broom clean.

### Care Placement

**What is senior care placement?**
A personalized service that helps families find the right assisted living, memory care, or board-and-care home based on medical needs, preferences, and budget.

**Is there a cost for your care placement services?**
No. Our services are free to families. We're paid by the care communities.

**How quickly can you help us find a care home?**
In urgent situations, placements can happen within 24–72 hours.

### Cash Offers

**How does a cash home offer work?**
A cash buyer purchases your home without financing, speeding up the process and reducing complications like appraisals and loan approvals.

**Do I need to make repairs or clean out the home?**
No. We buy homes in any condition—as-is.

**Are there any fees, commissions, or closing costs?**
No commissions, no closing costs, and no hidden fees.
