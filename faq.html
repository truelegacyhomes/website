              An estate sale is basically a garage sale on steroids. Garage sales are great if you want to sell some items and make a few hundred bucks over a weekend. Estate sales are used for when you want to sell all (or almost all) of the contents of a home. Estate sales are typically utilized when a loved one passes and you inherit a home, or if you need to downsize homes and need to sell a lot of big items quickly.
